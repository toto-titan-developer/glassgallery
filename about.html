                When I was a teenager I saw an ad that began my enthusiasm for designing and programming video games. Unfortunately the school I went to offered no extracurricular in software or hardware. Due to the situation I began learning the concepts on my own through a program called Game Maker Studios. The SDK(Software Development Kit) used a markup language derived from aspects of Javascript, C++ and C#. Most of the games I made were remakes of arcade games but GMS started a spark inside me. That spark has grown into the raging fire for my love of software development today. <br>

                I believe having my first job at the age of 13 is what nurtured my mature behavior in the workplace. This caused me to dive head on into the workforce straight out of highschool. Initially I went into cooking which taught me about the importance of organization and efficiency. While dealing with lines of tourists that would be extended outside I had to train myself to stay calm under high pressure. <br>

                I eventually moved away from my hometown of  Rossland BC and moved to Ontario to begin my adventure in sales and marketing D2D. I was anything but gifted when I first started but I didn’t let that stop me. I started learning about concepts of psychology, human interaction and body language. The progress was slow at first but one week everything came together. I developed a thick skin and simply put in more effort than anyone else, knocked on more doors, talked to more people and played the law of averages. I learned that sales wasn’t about trying to force a product down someone's throat but to instead market to the people it appeals to. This mind-set led me into a summer of being the top performer for the nation week after week leading to my promotion to a team leader and soon after the youngest field manager for Global Faces Direct. The D2D industry gave me an opportunity to travel all over Ontario, New Brunswick and Nova Scotia. Over the years I advanced my skills in leadership, management, sales, customer service, communication and much more. <br>

                In late 2018 my fire for software re-ignited with more direction towards applications and web design. Since then I have taken online courses for HTML, CSS, Javascript, JQuery, Node.js, React and SQL. While most of my time was learning front-end development I taught myself C# and .net to build little games in the Unity 3D SDK.
